Quick rundown on the stuff found here:

A3 impulse response stuff is all done in transferFunctionFinal.py

A4 impulse response stuff is split into to files:
  transferFunctionA4add.py, which handles all of the antenna transfer function stuff
  sigChainA4.py, which handles all of the signal channel stuff
  To actually create all of the final transfer functions you can just run doAllSigChainAndAntennas

Most of the data required for both of these can be found on the elog, other stuff can be found on Hawaii servers, Chicago servers, etc.
